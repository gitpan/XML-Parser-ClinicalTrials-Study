      Background:

      It may be in the interest of the CCR to continue to follow and treat certain subjects after
      they have completed their treatment and participation on a research protocol.

      Objective:

      To provide continuing treatment and medical follow-up for CCR subjects who have completed
      their treatment and participation on a research protocol and who are not currently entered
      on or eligible for another active research protocol.

      Eligibility:

      Subjects who have been previously enrolled on and received treatment according to an
      approved CCR research protocol. (clinical trial)

      It is in the best interest of the subject and the CCR for the subject to continue to receive
      standard care and follow-up at the NIH.

      Design:

      Medical/surgical/radiotherapeutic care, treatment and follow-up is provided for CCR subjects
      who have completed their treatment and participation on a research protocol and who are not
      currently entered on an active research protocol.

      No investigational treatments will be administered. This protocol is not be used as a
      platform to perform pilot studies of off-label uses for standard agents.
