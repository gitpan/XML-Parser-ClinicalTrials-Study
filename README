XML::Parser::ClinicalTrials::Study
----------------------------------

An XML parser/representation for ClinicalTrials.gov data.

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Slurp;
        use XML::Parser::ClinicalTrials::Study;

        # XML file downloaded from clinicaltrials.gov
        my $xml   = read_file( 'NCT00003095.xml', binmode => ':utf8' );
        my $study = XML::Parser::ClinicalTrials::Study->new( xml => $xml );

DESCRIPTION
    The web site <http://clinicaltrials.gov/> publishes information about
    pharmaceutical clinical trials. This module parses the XML files
    available for those trials into Moose objects with data accessors. For
    more details about the contents of these files, see the glossary of
    CT.gov site terms at <http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/glossary>.

ACCESSORS
    Study instances have several accessors, both simple value accessors and
    object accessors.

  Value Accessors
    These accessors provide simple values. When a value is not present in
    the XML file, this accessor will return the empty string.

    *   nct_number

    *   sponsor

    *   condition

    *   study_design

    *   description

    *   recruitment_status

    *   source

    *   summary

    *   type

    *   brief_title

    *   official_title

    *   phase

    *   start_date

    *   last_changed

    *   first_received

    *   completion_date

    *   estimated_completion_date

    *   primary_completion_date

    *   actual_enrollment

    *   estimated_enrollment

    *   normalized_phase

  Object Accessors
    These accessors provide array references of other Moose objects with
    their own accessors. Where a value is not present in the source XML
    file, the returned array reference will be empty.

    *   link

        An array reference of XML::Parser::ClinicalTrials::Study::Link
        objects.

    *   interventions

        An array reference of
        XML::Parser::ClinicalTrials::Study::Intervention objects.

    *   design

        An array reference of XML::Parser::ClinicalTrials::Study::Design
        objects.

    *   mesh_terms

        An array reference of XML::Parser::ClinicalTrials::Study::MeSHTerm
        objects.

    *   locations

        An array reference of XML::Parser::ClinicalTrials::Study::Location
        objects.

    *   contacts

        An array reference of XML::Parser::ClinicalTrials::Study::Contact
        objects.

NOTES
    These modules don't represent *all* of the data found in CT.gov XML
    files. Patches welcome.
